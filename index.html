<h1>Talk about the important</h1>
<p>
How often did you think that this world is unreal? As if all this traced reality is just tinsel, hiding <br>
other, more important things. Think logically how many non-matches both in our history <br>
and in our nature. Dozens of false facts are so ingrained in human nature that no one even<br>
thinks to ask questions. "This is an obvious fact" - The standard response of the herd man.<br>
One has only to think, grabbing a subtle thought, as a clump of various facts falls on your head.<br>
"What for?" -You ask. The mere thought of possible freedom pushed people to rebellion,<br>
and imagine what would happen if a modern person finds out something superfluous. The familia<br>
feeling of security and comfort in concrete boxes sinks into oblivion. Are we ready for the truth?<br>
